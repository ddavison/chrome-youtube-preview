> Hovering over YouTube video links or thumbnails will bring up a layer that shows
  a brief description of the video.

Why it was devised
==================

If you're like me, you're tired of going to YouTube videos that
have a title of something that looks appealing; all to find out
that the video is garbage.  It has a tremendous amount of downvotes,
and really wasn't worth watching.

This previewer allows you to see the ratings before you go to the video
to determine whether or not it's worth your time.
